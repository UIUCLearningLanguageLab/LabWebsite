__Email:__ jmontag@illinois.edu

__Website:__ http://languagestats.com/jessicamontag/
	

Jessica Montag studies how language abilities emerge with experience across the lifespan, including language comprehension, production, and reading. Dr. Montag uses varied methods and measures, including comprehension and production experiments in adults and children, compilation and analyses of text and speech corpora, and advanced quantitative methods.
	

### Dr. Jon A. Willits

Jon Willits studies language and learning in infants, children, adults, and machines. His research uses computational, neurobiological, experimental, and naturalistic methods to better understand how people and machines learn, represent, and use languages and other forms of complex knowledge, especially word meanings and semantic knowledge.

__Email:__ enmech2@illinois.edu

__Github:__ http://github.com/emilymech

__ResearchGate:__ http://researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Mech
	

Emily Mech utilizes event-related potentials (ERPs), computational modeling, and behavioral methodology to examine how regularities in language and the world interact to affect the ways in which our linguistic and semantic knowledge is learned, structured, accessed, and communicated.

### Shufan Mao

<img src="../img/shufan.jpg" alt="Shufan" width="200"/>

__Email:__ smao9@illinois.edu

Shufan Mao is interested in representation of semantics, concept, and meanings. He is working on a distributional representation of concept and semantics using a network model which integrates distributional semantics, formal semantics and network science.

### Jacki Erens
