### Undergraduate Research Assistants
We are looking for motivated undergraduate students to assist with data collection and analysis in our lab. Students will gain valuable research and statistical skills, and may have the opportunity to complete their own project. Students typically work about 10-15 hours per week and in special circumstances, 
funding may be available for paying student research assistants. 

We typically recruit undergraduate research assistants at the beginning of each semester, and if we are currently posting, the ad will be here: https://psychology.illinois.edu/research/research-opportunities.

<!--- For additional information, please email Dr. Montag or Dr. Willits the week before a new semester begins or during the first week of a new semester.

### Hourly Undergraduate or Post-Baccalaureate Research Assistants (Paid)
We are looking for a few undergraduates or recent graduates with special skills who may be interested in working in the lab for 10-30 hours per week for pay. These skills include coding proficiency in at least one of the following: Python, SQL, web development, or game programming (iOS and/or Unity). We are also looking for individuals with experience transcribing natural language recordings. For additional information, please email Dr. Montag or Dr. Willits.
